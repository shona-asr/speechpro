SpeechGenius Application development
Project Overview
Create a modern web application called "SpeechGenius" that provides speech processing services including transcription, translation, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech conversion. The application should have a clean, intuitive UI and robust backend services.
Core Requirements
Authentication & User Management
Implement Firebase Authentication for user management
Support email/password and Google sign-in methods
Create a user profile system that stores user preferences and history
Ensure proper token handling and session management

Speech Processing Services
Transcription Service: Integrate with an external API for audio transcription (no authentication required)
Translation Service: Use Google Cloud Translation API for text translation
Text-to-Speech Service: Use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for converting text to speech
Speech-to-Speech Service: Use Google Cloud services for speech-to-speech conversion

Backend Architecture
Build a Node.js/Express backend with javaScript 
Implement proper error handling and logging

Frontend Architecture
Develop a React application with javaScript
Use React Query for data fetching and state management
Implement a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
Create reusable components for common UI elements
Use a modern UI library (like shadcn/ui) for consistent styling

Database
Implement a simple firebase solution for storing user data and history
Create schemas for transcriptions, translations, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech items
Ensure proper data validation using Zod

API Design
Create RESTful APIs for all speech processing services
Implement proper authentication middleware
Use proper HTTP status codes and error responses

Security Considerations
Secure storage of API keys and credentials
Implement proper CORS policies
Validate all user inputs
Handle file uploads securely
Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

Deployment
Create a deployment strategy for both development and production environments
Implement proper logging and monitoring
Create documentation for setup and maintenance
Technical Specifications
Backend: Node.js, Express, javaScript
Frontend: React, TypeScript, React Query
Authentication: Firebase Authentication
Cloud Services: Google Cloud (Translation, Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text)

Deliverables
Complete source code for both frontend and backend
Setup instructions and documentation
API documentation
User guide
This system should be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy addition of new speech processing features in the future. The architecture should be modular and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between different components.
